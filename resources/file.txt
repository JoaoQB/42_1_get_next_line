Reptiles and amphibians are sometimes seen as simple, primitive creatures.
That's a long way from the truth.
The fact that they are solar-powered means that their bodies require
only 10% of the energy that mammals of a similar size require.
At a time when we ourselves are becoming increasingly concerned about
the way in which we get our energy from the environment and the wasteful
way in which we use it, maybe there are things that we can learn from Life
in Cold Blood.
